# bachelor-thesis
this is my bachelor thesis, which took way too long to write

\begin{abstract}
The evolution equations of incompressible, two-phase flow in porous media are considered. An introduction to conservation laws and finite volume methods, in order to solve them, are given. And an IMPES-method, for approximating the equations of two-phase flow is studied, which is demonstrated by a numerical experiment.
